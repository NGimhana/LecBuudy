# Smart Lecture Partner

## Introduction

Smart Lecture Partner is motion detection and OCR based handwriting recognition mobile application. This is a solution presented for students and lecturers when attending and conducting crowded lectures.

In the students' point of view, students have to write down notes continuously. Further, if he/she couldn't go early to the lecture, they surely have take back seats and hence their focus may lose.

In the Lectures point of view, they always have to check with students whether their handwriting is clear enough to get an idea to students. Further, they have to operate presentations manually while teaching.

## Solution

This sample project created as a solution for above discussed issues. Students will have a automated note capturing device and clear vision from any side of the board and slides. Lectures will have automatically sliding beteween slides and can pursue teaching without considering the clarity of the hand writting.Motion Capturing is done by image processing and OCR recognition is done by MS Azure Cognitive services.
